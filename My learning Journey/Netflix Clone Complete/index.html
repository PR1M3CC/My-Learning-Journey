              The Netflix Kids experience is included in your membership to give
              parents control while kids enjoy family-friendly TV shows and
              movies in their own space. Kids profiles come with PIN-protected
              parental controls that let you restrict the maturity rating of
              content kids can watch and block specific titles you don’t want
              kids to see.
